# xcover

Profile coverage of functional tests without instrumenting your binaries.

`xcover` (pronounced 'cross cover') enables to profile functional test coverage, by leveraging kernel instrumentation to probe functions in userland, and it's cross language.
This makes possible to measure coverage on ELF binaries without ecosystem-specific instrumentation like [Go cover](https://go.dev/doc/build-cover) or [LLVM cov](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-cov.html) require.

## CLI Reference

## xcover

xcover is a functional test coverage profiler

### Synopsis


xcover is a functional test coverage profiler.

Run the 'start' command to run the profiler that will trace all the functions of the tracee program.
Wait for the profiler to be ready before running your tests, with the 'wait' command.
Once the profiler is ready to trace all the functions, you can start running your tests.
At the end of your tests, the profiler can be stopped and a report being collected.


### Options

```
  -h, --help               help for xcover
      --log-level string   Log level (trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal, panic) (default "info")
```

### SEE ALSO

* [xcover start](docs/xcover_start.md)	 - Start the coverage profiling for a program
* [xcover status](docs/xcover_status.md)	 - Check the the xcover profiler status
* [xcover stop](docs/xcover_stop.md)	 - Stop the xcover profiler daemon
* [xcover wait](docs/xcover_wait.md)	 - Wait for the xcover profiler to be ready



## Filter

### Filter by process

```shell
xcover start --pid PID
```

### Filter by binary

```shell
xcover start --path EXE_PATH
```

### Filter functions

For including specific functions:

```shell
xcover start --path EXE_PATH --include "^github.com/maxgio92/xcover"
```

or excluding some:

```shell
xcover start --path EXE_PATH --exclude "^runtime.|^internal"
```

## Daemon mode

You can run the profiler as daemon with the `--detach` flag:

```shell
$ xcover start --detach --path /path/to/bin
```

Check the status with the `status` command:

```shell
$ xcover status
xcover is running (PID 1234)
```

And stop it with the `stop` command:

```shell
$ xcover stop
xcover is stopped
```

## Report

A coverage report is generated by default, and can be controlled with the `start` command's `--report` flag.

The report is provided in JSON format and contains
* the functions that have been traced
* the functions acknowledged
* the coverage by function percentage
* the executable path

```go
type CoverageReport struct {
	FuncsTraced []string `json:"funcs_traced"`
	FuncsAck    []string `json:"funcs_ack"`
	CovByFunc   float64  `json:"cov_by_func"`
	ExePath     string   `json:"exe_path"`
}
```

For instance:

```shell
$ xcover start --path myapp --verbose=false --report
`^C5:02PM INF written report to xcover-report.json`
$ cat xcover-report.json | jq '.cov_by_func'
15.601900739176347
```

## Synchronization

It is possible to synchronize on the `xcover` readiness, meaning that userspace can proceed executing the tests because xcover is ready to trace them all.

You can use the `wait` command to wait for the `xcover` profiler to be ready:

```shell
$ xcover start --detach --path /path/to/bin
$ xcover wait
1:30PM INF waiting for the profiler to be ready
1:30PM INF profiler is ready
$ /path/to/bin test_1
$ /path/to/bin test_2
$ /path/to/bin test_3
$ xcover stop
```

and collect the coverage as `xcover-report.json`.

## Quickstart

A full example of usage is described below:

```shell
$ xcover start --detach --path /path/to/bin
$ xcover wait
xcover is ready
$ /path/to/bin test1
$ /path/to/bin test2
$ /path/to/bin test3
$ xcover stop
xcover is stopped
$ cat xcover_report.json | jq .cov_by_func
89.9786897
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- `bpftool` (to generate vmlinux.h for CORE)
- `clang`
- `go`
- `libbf-dev`

### Build all

By default it statically compile xcover with libbfgo, and libbpfgo with libbpf.

```shell
make xcover
```

### Build BPF only

```shell
make xcover/bpf
```

### Build frontend only

```shell
make xcover/frontend
```

### Run test

```shell
make test
```
